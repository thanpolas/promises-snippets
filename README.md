# Promise Snippets

Promises Pattern snippets for Sublime2

## Install

Clone this repository in your `Packages/` folder:

```
git clone git@github.com:thanpolas/promises-snippets.git
```

## Getting started

Just type `prom` on a javascript document and work with autocomplete.

The snippets are namespaced based on functionality, at most you'll have to type 4 chars and `Enter`:

<table>
  <tr><th>snippet</th><th>Category</th><th>Description</th></tr>
  <tr><td><strong>promise</strong>       </td><td>New      </td><td><code>return new Promise(function(resolve, reject) { ... });</code></td></tr>
</table>

## Contributing
I am using this package as a helper for my workflow with Promises, feel free to do the same by submitting snippets that you use in yours.
